      Credit cards and debit cards are both physical cards that are tied to a
      financial account. You can use each type of card to pay for goods or
      services. The ways you use them for transactions are also the same. For
      physical transactions, the most common option is to insert your card or
      swipe it in a card reader. For online transactions, you type in your card
      information.
